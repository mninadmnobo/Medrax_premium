"""
Abstention Logic: Decide when to abstain from making a conflict resolution.

Instead of always picking a winner, this module knows when to say "I don't know,
needs human review" based on multiple signals:

1. Circular logic detected (graph has cycles)
2. Vote too close (support vs attack strengths are similar)
3. Uncertainty too high (overall confidence in decision is low)
4. Clinical severity matters (be more careful with critical conditions)

This makes the system clinically safer by not forcing decisions when unclear.
